        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I am Tao Wang, a Research Fellow in Health Text Analytics and Data Science at King's College London. My expertise lies in applying advanced AI and Data Science techniques to healthcare challenges, particularly in mental health.</p>
        
        <p>My research focuses on leveraging natural language processing, machine learning, and knowledge representation to improve mental health services, advance clinical decision support, and address health inequalities. I collaborate with clinicians, NHS Trusts, and international research institutions to translate AI technologies into practical healthcare applications.</p>
        
        <p>My academic journey spans multiple disciplines and institutions. I completed a Ph.D. in Economics—funded by the ESRC—at the University of Southampton in collaboration with The Alan Turing Institute, where I focused on online social networks and eating disorders. I also hold an M.Sc. in Software Engineering from South China University of Technology (SCUT), where I participated in an exchange program at the Chinese University of Hong Kong.</p>
